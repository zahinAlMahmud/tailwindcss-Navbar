Let me give you a **clear overview of Wazuh** 👇

## 🔐 What is Wazuh?

Wazuh is an **open-source Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** tool.
It helps organizations **monitor, detect, and respond** to security threats in real time.

Think of it as your **security guard + detective** for servers, applications, and networks.

---

## ⚡ Key Features of Wazuh:

1. **Log Data Collection & Analysis**

   * Collects logs from servers, applications, cloud, and containers.
   * Detects suspicious patterns in real time.

2. **Threat Detection**

   * Uses built-in rules and threat intelligence feeds.
   * Can detect malware, intrusions, and anomalies.

3. **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)**

   * Monitors changes in critical system files.
   * Alerts if someone modifies or tampers with them.

4. **Vulnerability Detection**

   * Scans systems for outdated software and known vulnerabilities.

5. **Compliance Reporting**

   * Helps meet standards like **GDPR, PCI DSS, HIPAA, ISO 27001** by generating reports.

6. **Cloud & Container Security**

   * Works with AWS, Azure, GCP, Docker, and Kubernetes environments.

---

## 🏗️ Wazuh Architecture (Simple View)

* **Wazuh Agents** → Installed on endpoints (servers, PCs, containers).
* **Wazuh Manager** → Central brain that analyzes data from agents.
* **Elastic Stack (ELK)** → Stores and visualizes security data in dashboards.
* **Wazuh Dashboard** → Web interface to monitor alerts and incidents.

---

## ✅ Why Use Wazuh?

* It’s **free and open-source**.
* Competes with expensive SIEM tools like Splunk or QRadar.
* Scales well (small businesses → enterprises).
* Integrates with other tools (ELK, OSQuery, VirusTotal, Suricata, etc.).

---

👉 In short:
**Wazuh = Open-source SIEM + XDR platform** that gives you visibility, detection, and compliance in one package.

---

⚡ Do you want me to also make a **diagram (architecture figure)** to better visualize how Wazuh works?
